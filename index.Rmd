# Introduction {-}

Tools of causal inference are the basic statistical building block behind most scientific results.
It is thus extremely useful to have an open source collectively aggreed upon resource presenting and assessing them, as well as listing the current unresolved issues.
The content of this book covers the basic theoretical knowledge and technical skills required for implementing staistical methods of causal inference.
This means:

* Understanding of the basic language to encode causality,
* Knowledge of the fundamental problems of inference and the biases of intuitive estimators,
* Understanding of how econometric methods recover treatment effects,
* Ability to compute these estimators along with an estimate of their precision using the statistical software R combined with latex using Rmarkdown.

All the notions and estimators are introduced using a numerical example and simulations. 

This book is written in Rmarkdown using the bookdown package.
It is available both as a [web-book](https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/) and as a [pdf book](https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/STCI.pdf).

This book is a collaborative effort that is part of the [Social Science Knowledge Accumulation Initiative (SKY)](https://chabefer.github.io/SKY/). 
The code behind this book is publically available on GitHub and you can propose corrections and updates.
