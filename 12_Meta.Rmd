# Meta-analysis and Publication Bias {#sec:meta}

When several research teams work on a similar topic, they obtain and publish several estimates for the same program of for similar programs.
For example, teams of doctors regularly test the same treatment on different samples or populations in order to refine the estimated effect.
Similarly, economists report on the effects of similar types of programs (Conditional and Unconditional Cash Transfers, Job Training Programs, microcredit, etc) implemented in different countries.

Meta-analysis aims at summarizing and synthetizing the available evidence with two main goals in mind:

  1. Increasing precision by providing an average estimated effect combining several estimates
  2. Explaining variations in treatment effectiveness by relating changes in effect size to changes in sample characteristics.
  
One key issue that meta-analysis has to face -- actually, we all have to face it, meta-analysis simply makes it more apparent -- is that of publication bias.
Publication bias is due to the fact that referees and editors have a marked preference for publishing statistically significant results. 
The problem with this approach is that the distribution of published results is going to be censored on the left: we will have more statistically significant results in the published record, and as a consequence, the average published result will be an upward biased estimate of the true treatment effect in the population.
This is potentially a very severe problem if the amount of censoring due to publication bias is large.
Eventually, this hinges on the true distribution of treatment effects: if it is centered on zero or close to zero, we run the risk of having very large publication bias.

In this chapter, I present first the tools for meta-analysis, and I then move on to testing and correcting for publication bias.Most of the material presented here stems from the reference book by [Hedges and Olkin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780080570655/statistical-methods-for-meta-analysis).
When needed, I update this book with new references that I then cite.
the R code comes mainly from a [wonderful set of slides](http://www.edii.uclm.es/~useR-2013/Tutorials/kovalchik/kovalchik_meta_tutorial.pdf) explaining of the `metafor` package works. 

## Meta-analysis

There are several approaches and refinements to meta-analysis. 
In this section, I am going to present only the most important ones.
I'll defer the reader to other more specialized publications if needed.

I first present the basics of meta-analysis: the constitution and structure of the sample.
Second, I present the simplest method to aggregate effects: the weighted average.
Third, I present tests for deciding whether the effects are from a homogeneous or a heterogeneous population.
Fourth, I explain how to conduct a meta-analysis when effects are heterogeneous.
Fifth, I cover the meta-regression that we use to account for heterogeneity in treatment effects.
Finally, I explain why usual intuitive methods such as vote-counting are biased.

### Basic setting

The basic setting for a meta-analysis is that you have access to a list of estimates for the effect of a given program and for their precision.
These estimates come from the literature, searching published and unpublished sources alike.
This data is usually collected after an extensive search of bibliographic databases.
Then, one has to select among all the studies selected by the search the ones that are actualy relevant.
This is the most excruciating part of a meta-analysis, since a lot of the studies selected by hte search algorithm are actually irrelevant.
Finally, one has to extract from each relevant paper an estimate of the effect of the treatment and of its precision.
In general, one tries to choose standardized estimates such as the effect size (see Section \@ref(sec:effectsize) for a definition) and its standard error. 
After all this process, we should end up with a dataset like: $\left\{(\hat{\theta}_k,\hat{\sigma}_k)\right\}_{k=1}^N$, with $\hat{\theta}_k$ the estimated effect size, $\hat{\sigma}_k$ its estimated standard error, and $N$ the number of included studies.

```{example}
Let's see how such a dataset would look like? 
Let's build one from our simulations.
```

```{r confintervalESCLT,dependson=c('monte.carlo'),eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap=paste('Example data set: effect sizes and confidence intervals with $\\delta=$',delta.2,sep=' '),fig.align='center',out.width=cst,fig.pos='htbp',fig.height=8,fig.width=12}
N.sample <- c(100,1000,10000,100000)
N.plot.ES.CLT <- c(10,7,2,1)
data.meta <- data.frame(ES=numeric(),
                          se=numeric())

se.ww.CLT.ES <- function(N,v1,v0,p){
  return(sqrt((v1/p+v0/(1-p))/N)/v0)
}

for (k in 1:length(N.sample)){
  set.seed(1234)
  simuls.ww[[k]]$se.ES <- se.ww.CLT.ES(N.sample[[k]],simuls.ww[[k]][,'V1'],simuls.ww[[k]][,'V0'],simuls.ww[[k]][,'p'])
  test.ES <- simuls.ww[[k]][sample(N.plot.ES.CLT[[k]]),c('ES','se.ES')]
  test.ES$N <- rep(N.sample[[k]],N.plot.ES.CLT[[k]])
  data.meta <- rbind(data.meta,test.ES)
  }

data.meta$id <- 1:nrow(data.meta)
#data.meta$N <- factor(data.meta$N,levels(N.sample))

  ggplot(data.meta, aes(x=as.factor(id), y=ES)) +
      geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=ES-qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES, ymax=ES+qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9),color='blue') +
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept=ES(param)), colour="#990000", linetype="dashed")+
      xlab("Studies")+
      ylab("Effect size")+
      theme_bw()

```

Figure \@ref(fig:confintervalESCLT) shows the resulting sample. 
I've selected `r N.plot.ES.CLT[[1]]` studies with $N=$ `r N.sample[[1]]`, `r N.plot.ES.CLT[[2]]` studies with $N=$ `r N.sample[[2]]`, `r N.plot.ES.CLT[[3]]` studies with $N=$ `r N.sample[[3]]`, and `r N.plot.ES.CLT[[4]]` study with $N=$ `r N.sample[[4]]`.
The studies are represented in that order, mimicking the increasing sample size of studies that accumulate evidence on a treatment, probably with studies with a small sample size at first, and only large studies at the end for the most promising treatments.

### Meta-analysis as a weighted average {#MetaWA}

The key idea of meta-analysis is to combine the effect size estimates stemming from different studies, weighing them by their relative precision.

```{definition,metaweights,name='Weighted Meta-Analytic Estimator'}
The weighted meta-analytic estimator is
$$
\bar{\theta} = \sum_{k=1}^Nw_k\hat{\theta}_k \text{ with } w_k=\frac{\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}}{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}}.
$$
```

Under some assumptions, the estimator $\bar{\theta}$ converges to the true effect of the treatment.
Let's delineate these assumptions.

```{definition,metahomo,name='Homogeneous Treatment Effect'}
Each $\hat{\theta}_k$ converges to the same treatment effect $\theta$.
```

Assumption \@ref(def:metahomo) imposes that all the studies have been drawn from the same population, where the treatment effect is a constant.

```{definition,metaind,name='Independence of Estimates'}
The $\hat{\theta}_k$ are independent from each other.
```

Assumption \@ref(def:metaind) imposes that all the studies estimates are independent from each other.
That means that they do not share sampling units and that they are not affected by common shocks.

Under these assumptions, we can show two important results.

```{theorem,metafixedcons,name='Consistency of the Weighted Meta-Analytic Estimator'}
Under Assumptions \@ref(def:metahomo) and \@ref(def:metaind), when the sample size of each study goes to infinity, $\bar{\theta}\approx\theta$.
```

```{proof}
The Law of Large Number applied to each sample gives the fact that the estimator is a weighted sum of $\theta$ with weights summing to one. 
Hence the result.
```

Theorem \@ref(thm:metafixedcons) says that the error we are making around the true effect of the treatment goes to zero as the sample size in each study decrease.
This is great: aggregating the studies is thus going to get us to the truth.

```{remark}
One interesting question is whether Theorem \@ref(thm:metafixedcons) also holds when the size of the individual studies remains fixed and the number of studies goes to infinity, which seems a more natural way to do asymptotics in a meta-analysis. 
I'm pretty sure that is the case.
Indeed, the studies constitute an enormous sample in which we take the average outcomes of the treated on the one hand and of the untreated on the other.
These averages differ from the usual ones in the Law of Large Numbers only by the fact that the weights are not equal to one.
But they (i) are independent from the outcomes and (ii) sum to one.
As a consequence, I'm pretty sure the Law of Large Numbers also apply in this dimension.
```

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Check if this is a consequence of Kolmogorov's Law of Large Numbers.</span>**

```{theorem,metafixeddis,name='Asymptotic Distribution of the Weighted Meta-Analytic Estimator'}
Under Assumptions \@ref(def:metahomo) and \@ref(def:metaind), when the sample size of each study goes to infinity, $\bar{\theta}\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}(\theta,\sigma^2)$, with
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\sigma^2_k}}.
$$
```

```{proof}
**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">To do using the Lindenberg-Levy version of the Central Limit Theorem.</span>**
```

Theorem \@ref(thm:metafixeddis) shows that the distribution of the weighted meta-analytic estimator converges to a normal, which is very convenient in order to compute sampling noise.
In order to obtain an estimator $\hat{\sigma}^2$ of the variance of the meta-analytic estimator, we can simply replace the individual variance terms by their estimates: $\hat{\sigma}_k^2$.

```{remark}
I've taken Theorem \@ref(thm:metafixeddis) from Hedges and Olkin, but I think it is much more interesting and correct when the asymptotics goes in the number of studies.
```

```{remark}
According to Hedges and Olkin, the weighted meta-analytic estimator is the most efficient estimator available.
```

```{r WMAE,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
wmae <- function(theta,sigma2){
  return(c(weighted.mean(theta,(1/sigma2)/(sum(1/sigma2))),1/sum(1/sigma2)))
}
```

```{example}
Let's use our meta-analytic estimator to estimate the effect size of our treatment.
```
The estimated treatment effect size with our sample is `r round(wmae(data.meta$ES,data.meta$se.ES^2)[[1]],2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*sqrt(wmae(data.meta$ES,data.meta$se.ES^2)[[2]]),2)`.
A very simple way to implement such an estimator in R is to use the `rma` command of the `metafor` package.

```{r metafor.example,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='markup',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
data.meta$var.ES <- data.meta$se.ES^2
meta.example.FE <- rma(yi = data.meta$ES,vi=data.meta$var.ES,method="FE")
summary(meta.example.FE)
```

As seen above, the `metafor` package yields a meta-analytic estimate of `r round(coef(meta.example.FE),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*summary(meta.example.FE)$se,2)`, as we have found using the weighted meta-analytic estimator.

It is customary to present the results of a meta-analysis using a forest plot.
A forest plows all the individual estimates along with the aggregated estimate.
Figure \@ref(fig:FEforestplot) presents the forest plot for our example using the very convenient `forest` function in the `metafor` package:

```{r FEforestplot,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,results=FALSE,fig.cap='Example data set: forest plot', fig.align='center', out.width=cst, fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
forest(meta.example.FE,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab='Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter')
```

### Constantly updated meta-analysis

Constantly updated meta-analysis performs the meta-analysis in a progressive manner, as the results keep arriving.
This is a very important tool that enables us to aggregate constantly the information coming from different studies.
Moreover, restrospectively, it helps us to assess when we would have reached enough precision so that we could have foregone an additional study.
The way constantly updated meta-analysis works is simply by performing a new meta-analysis each time a new results pops up.

```{example}
Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE) shows how constantly updated meta-analysis works in our example.
```

```{r cumWMAE,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Constantly updated meta-analysis',fig.subcap=c('Initial data set','Constantly updated dataset'), fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
cum.wmae.1 <- function(k,theta,sigma2){
  return(c(weighted.mean(theta[1:k],(1/sigma2[1:k])/(sum(1/sigma2[1:k]))),1/sum(1/sigma2[1:k])))
}

cum.wmae <- function(theta,sigma2){
  return(sapply(1:length(theta),cum.wmae.1,theta=theta,sigma2=sigma2))
}

cum.test <- as.data.frame(t(cum.wmae(data.meta$ES,data.meta$se.ES^2)))
colnames(cum.test) <- c('cum.ES','cum.var')
cum.test$id <- 1:nrow(cum.test)
cum.test$cum.se.ES <- sqrt(cum.test$cum.var)

  ggplot(data.meta, aes(x=forcats::fct_rev(as.factor(id)), y=ES)) +
      geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=ES-qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES, ymax=ES+qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9),color='blue') +
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept=ES(param)), colour="#990000", linetype="dashed")+
      xlab("Studies")+
      ylab("Initial effect size")+
      theme_bw()+
      coord_flip()

  ggplot(cum.test, aes(x=forcats::fct_rev(as.factor(id)), y=cum.ES)) +
      geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=cum.ES-qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*cum.se.ES, ymax=cum.ES+qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*cum.se.ES), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9),color='blue') +
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept=ES(param)), colour="#990000", linetype="dashed")+
      xlab("Studies")+
      ylab("Cumulative effect size")+
      theme_bw()+
      coord_flip()

```

Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE) shows that combining several imprecise estimates might help you reach the same precision as running a larger experiment.  
For instance, cumulating the first 10 studies with a small sample size ($N=$ `r N.sample[[1]]`), the meta-analytic effect is estimated at `r round(select(filter(cum.test,id==10),cum.ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(cum.test,id==10),cum.se.ES),2)`. 
This is very close to the individual estimate obtained from the first estimate with a larger sample size (sample 11 on Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE), with $N=$ `r N.sample[[2]]`): `r round(select(filter(data.meta,id==11),ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(data.meta,id==11),se.ES),2)`. 
Both estimates actually have the exact same precision (because they actually have the same sample size).
The same is true when combining the first 17 studies.
The meta-analytic effect is estimated at `r round(select(filter(cum.test,id==17),cum.ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(cum.test,id==17),cum.se.ES),2)`, while the effect estimated using one unique RCT with a larger sample size (sample 18 on Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE), with $N=$ `r N.sample[[3]]`) is  `r round(select(filter(data.meta,id==18),ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(data.meta,id==18),se.ES),2)`. 
Finally, the same result occurs when combining the first 19 studies.
The meta-analytic effect is estimated at `r round(select(filter(cum.test,id==19),cum.ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(cum.test,id==19),cum.se.ES),2)`, while the effect estimated using one unique RCT with a larger sample size (sample 20 on Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE), with $N=$ `r N.sample[[4]]`) is  `r round(select(filter(data.meta,id==20),ES),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*select(filter(data.meta,id==20),se.ES),2)`. 

As a conclusion, constantly updated meta-analysis would have each time delivered the same result than the one found with a much larger study, rendering this additional study almost irrelevant.
This is a very important result: beyond the apparent messiness of the first noisy estimates in Figures \@ref(fig:confintervalESCLT) and \@ref(fig:FEforestplot) lies an order that can be retrieved and made apparent using constantly updated meta-analysis.
Sometimes, the answer is right there in front of our eyes, we just lack the ability to see it.
Constantly updated meta-analysis serves as a binocular to magnify what is there.
Think about how costly it woud be to run a very large study, just to find out that the we did not really need it because we had known the result all along.

```{remark}
Something pretty cool is that I can reproduce Figure \@ref(fig:cumWMAE) using the `metafor` package with much less lines of code.
```

```{r cumWMAEmetafor,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Constantly updated meta-analysis with the `metafor` package',fig.subcap=c('Initial data set','Constantly updated dataset'), fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
forest(meta.example.FE,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab='Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter')
cumul.meta.example.FE <- cumul(meta.example.FE, order=data.meta$id)
forest(cumul.meta.example.FE,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab='Estimated Meta-analytic Cumulated Parameter')
```

You can also call each of the individual results of the cumulative meta-analysis using `cumul.meta.example.FE$estimate`. 
For example, the cumulated effect size after the 10 first studies is equal to `r round(cumul.meta.example.FE$estimate[[10]],2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*cumul.meta.example.FE$se[[10]],2)`.

### Testing for the homogeneity of treatment effects

One key assumption that we have just made so far is that of homogeneous treatment effect.
We have worked under the assumption that each study was drawn from the same population, where the treatment effect is a constant.
Why would the treatment effects differ in each study?

  1. We do not study exactly the same treatment, but a family of similar treatments.
  Each individual study covers a particular iteration of the treatment, each with its idiosyncratic parameterization.
  The particular value of the transfer in a Cash Transfer program, or of the conditions to receive it, or the length of payment, whether it is in one time or over some period, might make a difference, for example.
  The same is true for Job Training Programs, Payments for Environmental Services, microcredit, graduation programs, nudges, etc.
  Actually, most programs that economists study differ from one implementation to the next.
  In psychology and medecine, most treatments are accompanied by a rigorous protocol that makes them much more homogeneous.
  2. The population on which the treatment is applied varies.
  For example, similar Job Training Programs or microcredit initiatives might have very different outcomes depending on the business cycle.
  Education interventions might have very different effects depending on the background of the students on which they are tested.
  A drug might interact with patients' phenotype and genotype to generate different effects, and the populations from which the experimental samples are drawn do not have to be similar.
  As an extreme example, think of a vaccine tested in a population where the prevalence of a disease is null.
  The treatment effect is zero.
  Now, test the vaccine in a population where the disease is endemic: the treatment effect might be huge.

We can also think that the treatment effect differs in each sample because the composition of the sample changes.
But this is normal variation due to sampling noise and is to be expected.
It is not the same thing as assuming that the population effect differs.

What can we do in order to test whether there is heterogeneity in treatment effects?
One way is to build an index comparing the usual variation in treatment effects stemming from sampling noise to the one stemming from variation between studies.
If we find that the variation between studies dwarves the variation due to sampling noise in each study, then there is some heterogeneity for sure.
One statistics that does that is the $Q$ statistic where the variation in treatment effects between studies is estimated using the difference between the individual effect size and the average one squared:

\begin{align*}
  Q & = \sum_{k=1}^N\frac{(\hat{\theta}_k-\bar{\theta})^2}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}.
\end{align*}

What is great with the $Q$ statistic is that, under the Null hypothesis that all the treatment effects are equal to the same constant, it is distributed asymptotically as a $\chi^2$ distribution with $N-1$ degrees of freedom, and thus it can directly be used to test for the hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects.

```{example}
In our example, we have already computed the $Q$ statistic when we have used the `rma` function in the `metafor` package. 
In order to access it, we just need to extract it using `meta.example.FE$QE` for the $Q$ statistic and `meta.example.FE$QEp` for its p-value.  
```
The $Q$ statistic in our example has value `r round(meta.example.FE$QE,2)`, with associated p-value `r round(meta.example.FE$QEp,2)`.
We end up not rejecting homogeneity, which is correct.

```{remark}
The problem with using test statistics for testing for treatment effect homogeneity is that, when precision increases, we might end up rejecting homogeneity despite the fact that it is there.
```

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Test with $N=10^5$.</span>**

```{remark}
The $\chi^2$ distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom is asymptotically distributed as a normal with mean $k$ and variance $2k$.
So, when $k$ is large, a good rule of thumb for assessing the homogeneity of the treatment effect estimates is to compare the $Q$ statistic to the number of studies. 
If it is much larger, homogeneity is probably not guaranteed.
```

### Meta-analysis when treatment effects are heterogeneous

When each study draws a treatment effect from a distinct population, meta-analysis has to take into account that treatment effects are heterogeneous.
The main consequence of treatment effect heterogeneity is that the weighting approach we have used so far underestimates the uncertainty around the true effect, since it does not acknowledge that there is additional variation within each study.

There are two main ways to account for heterogeneity in meta-analysis:

  1. **Meta-regression** trying to capture the heterogeneity in treatment effects with observed covariates.
  2. **Random effects** allowing for additional random noise in each study.
  
In this section, we are going to study the random effects approach, and we'll defer the meta-regression for the next section.

#### Estimating the variance of the treatment effect across sites

The key component of the random effects approach is the estimation of the size of the variance of the treatment effect in the population.
Indeed, the observed effect size estimate for a given study $k$ is modelled as follows in the random effects approach:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\theta}_k & = \alpha + \epsilon_k + \nu_k,
\end{align*}

where $\epsilon_k$ is due to sampling noise and $\nu_k$ is due to the heterogeneity in effect sizes across sites, while $\alpha$ is the average of the effect size accross all populations.
We denote the variance of $\nu_k$ as $\tau^2$.

Since Hedges, $\tau^2$ is estimated as the residual variance in effect sizes that is not explained by sampling noise.
In order to compute this estimator, first estimate the overall variance in $\hat{\theta}_k$, then estimate the component of the variance due to sampling noise and finally take the difference between the two.
Hedges' estimator of the overall variance in effect sizes is:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\tau}^2 & = \hat{\sigma}^2_{tot}-\hat{\sigma}^2_{\epsilon},
\end{align*}

with

\begin{align*}
\hat{\sigma^2_{tot}} & = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N(\hat{\theta}_k-\bar{\theta}_u)^2\\
\bar{\theta}_u & = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N\hat{\theta}_k \\
\hat{\sigma^2_{\epsilon}} & = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N\hat{\sigma}_k^2.
\end{align*}

```{remark}
Hedges actually  uses the unbiased estimator adapted to small samples and thus replaces $N$ by $N-1$ in the first equation.
```

```{example}
Let's compute Hedges' esimator for $\tau^2$ in our numerical example.
```

Let's first define a few functions to compute each part:

```{r hedgestau,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,results=FALSE}
tau.2 <- function(theta,vartheta){
  return(var(theta)-mean(vartheta))
}
tau.2.theta <- tau.2(data.meta$ES,data.meta$se.ES^2)
```

Our estimate of $\tau^2$ in our example is thus `r round(tau.2.theta,2)`.
This estimate is small, suggesting that there is no additional variance in the treatment effects on top of sammling variation, as we know is the case and has already been suggested by the results of the $Q$ statistic.
Let's now create a new sample of effect sizes where we add noise to each estimate stemming not from sampling, but from heterogeneity in treatment effects across sites and studies.

```{r randomshockmeta,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,results=FALSE}
tau <- c(0.5,1)
set.seed(1234)
data.meta$theta.1 <- data.meta$ES + rnorm(nrow(data.meta),mean=0,sd=tau[[1]])
data.meta$theta.2 <- data.meta$ES + rnorm(nrow(data.meta),mean=0,sd=tau[[2]])
```

I've simulated two new vectors of estimates for $\theta$, both obtained adding a mean-zero normally distributed noise to the initial estimates of $\theta$, one with a standard deviation of `r tau[[1]]` and the other of `r tau[[2]]`.
Let's visualize our two new datasets:

```{r metanoiseplot,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Datasets with treatment effect heterogeneity',fig.subcap=c('initial',paste('$\\tau^2=$',tau[[1]],sep=' '),paste('$\\tau^2=$',tau[[2]],sep=' ')), fig.align='center', out.width="33%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}

      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=theta.2-qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES, ymax=theta.2+qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*se.ES), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9),color='blue') +

      ylab("Effect size")+
      theme_bw()+
      ylim(-2,2)
```

Let's see now how Hedge's estimator performs:

```{r hedgestaubis,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,results=FALSE}
tau.2.theta.1 <- tau.2(data.meta$theta.1,data.meta$se.ES^2)
tau.2.theta.2 <- tau.2(data.meta$theta.2,data.meta$se.ES^2)
```

Hedges' estimates of $\tau^2$ in our examples are thus `r round(tau.2.theta.1,2)` and  `r round(tau.2.theta.2,2)` respectively, while the true values are, respectively `r tau[[1]]^2` and `r tau[[2]]^2`.

#### Estimating the average effect of the treatment taking heterogeneity into account {#sec:RE}

Hedges proposes a new estimator for the average effect of the treatment, an estimator that accounts for the additional noise due to heterogeneous treatment effects accross sites.

```{definition,Hmetaweights,name='Hedges Weighted Meta-Analytic Estimator'}
Hedges weighted meta-analytic estimator for in the presence of random effects is
$$
\bar{\theta}_H = \sum_{k=1}^Nv_k\hat{\theta}_k \text{ with } v_k=\frac{\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k+\hat{\tau}^2}}{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k+\hat{\tau}^2}}.
$$
```

```{r HWMAE,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
Hwmae <- function(theta,sigma2,tau2){
  return(c(weighted.mean(theta,(1/sigma2)/(sum(1/(sigma2+tau2))),1/sum(1/sigma2+tau2))))
}
ES.H.theta.1 <- Hwmae(data.meta$theta.1,data.meta$se.ES^2,tau.2.theta.1)
ES.H.theta.2 <- Hwmae(data.meta$theta.2,data.meta$se.ES^2,tau.2.theta.2)
```

```{example}
Let's see how Hedges estimator performs in our example.
```
Hedges' estimates of the average effect size is equal to `r round(ES.H.theta.1,2)` and  `r round(ES.H.theta.2,2)` respectively, while the true value is `r round(ES(param),2)`.
The main problem with Hedges' estimator when treatment effects are heterogeneous is that very large effects for the more precise estimators dramatically affect the estimate.

```{remark}
Hedges' estimate of $\tau^2$  is slightly negative, which is problem, since a variance is always positive.
Other estimators of $\tau^2$ have been proposed in the literature to account for this fact and to respond to various shortcomings of Hedges' approach.
We will present them succinctly since they are part of the `metafor` package.
These other estimators have bames such as .
They are very well described in this [amazing set of slides](http://www.edii.uclm.es/~useR-2013/Tutorials/kovalchik/kovalchik_meta_tutorial.pdf). 
Besides Hedges' (denoted 'HE' in R), the other estimators are named:
```
  
  - DerSimonian-Laird ('DL')
  - Hunter-Schmidt ('HS')
  - Sidik-Jonkman ('SJ')
  - Maximum-likelihood ('ML')
  - Restricted maximum-likelihood ('REML')
  - Empirical Bayes ('EB')
  
I'll detail how they work later.

```{example}
For the moment, let's see how they perform in our numerical example.
```

```{r RandomOthersTau,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='asis',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Various estimators of $\\tau^2$',fig.align='center', out.width=cst, fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
estimators <- c("DL", "REML", "HE", "HS", "SJ", "ML", "EB")

#meta.example.RE <- sapply(estimators,function(method){return(rma(yi = data.meta$theta.1,vi=data.meta$var.ES,method=method))})
#meta.example.RE.tau2.test <- unlist(lapply(meta.example.RE,'[[','tau2'))

result.RE <- data.frame(Method=rep(estimators,2),tau2hat=c(meta.example.RE.theta.1.tau2,meta.example.RE.theta.2.tau2),tau2=c(rep(tau[[1]]^2,length(estimators)),rep(tau[[2]]^2,length(estimators))))

ggplot(data=result.RE, aes(x=Method, y=tau2hat, fill=as.factor(tau2))) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())+
    ylim(0,1)
```

We are ready to estimate the overall treatment effect using random effects.

```{r RandomOthersES,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='asis',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Various estimators of the treatment effect with random effects',fig.align='center', out.width=cst, fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}

ggplot(data=result.RE, aes(x=Method, y=ES.RE, fill=as.factor(tau2))) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())
```

#### Other estimators of inter-site variability

$\tau^2$ is a pretty difficult measure of treatment effect heterogeneity to interpret. 
That's why other indicators have been built that are easier to interpret. 
We are going to review several of them in this section.

The first alternative or complement to $\tau^2$ is Higgin's $I^2$:

\begin{align*}
  I^2 & = \frac{Q-(N-1)}{Q}*100
\end{align*}

The interpretation of $I^2$ is pretty straightforward: it is the distance between the actual value of the $Q$ statistic and its value under the null of treatment effect homogeneity (it is equal to the number of studies $N$, with a correction for degress of freedom).
It can also be interpreted as the fraction of the overall variance (remember that $Q$ is the sum of variance ratios) that is not explained by within study sampling noise.

Another complement to $\tau^2$ is $H^2$:

\begin{align*}
  H^2 & = \frac{Q}{N-1}
\end{align*}

If $H^2$ is above one, then there is unexplained heterogeneity, again by the fact that $Q$ has mean $N-1$ under the null of treatment effect homogeneity.

Finally, we can also define the Intra Class Correlation ($ICC$), which precisely measures the share of total variance attributable to treatment effect heterogeneity:

\begin{align*}
  ICC & = \frac{\tau^2}{\tau^2+S^2}
\end{align*}

Where $S^2$ is the amount of variance due to sampling noise. 
An estimator for $S^2$ is:

\begin{align*}
  S^2 & = \frac{(N-1)\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\sigma^2_k}}{(\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\sigma^2_k})^2-\sum_{k=1}^N(\frac{1}{\sigma^2_k})^2}.
\end{align*}

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I do not understand the formula for $S^2$. Why does it estimate what we want? I'd take the average variance.</span>**

$ICC$ and $I^2$ are related by the following very simple relation: $I^2=ICC*100$.

```{example}
Let's see how these three estimators look like in our example. 
The cool thing is that `rma` computes these estimators by default, so that a simple call to `summary()` is going to show them.
The default random effects estimator is `REML`, which is deemed to be the best of them all according to simulations [(Viechtbauer, 2002)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/10769986030003261).
```

```{r I2H2ICC,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='markup',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
meta.example.RE.ES <- rma(yi = data.meta$ES,vi=data.meta$var.ES)
meta.example.RE.theta.1 <- rma(yi = data.meta$theta.1,vi=data.meta$var.ES)
meta.example.RE.theta.2 <- rma(yi = data.meta$theta.2,vi=data.meta$var.ES)

tau2.hat <- c(meta.example.RE.ES$tau2,meta.example.RE.theta.1$tau2,meta.example.RE.theta.2$tau2)
I2 <-  c(meta.example.RE.theta.1$I2,meta.example.RE.theta.2$I2,meta.example.RE.ES$I2)
H2 <-  c(meta.example.RE.theta.1$H2,meta.example.RE.theta.2$H2,meta.example.RE.ES$H2)

# illustration of results returned by summary
summary(meta.example.RE.theta.2)
```

The estimate of $I^2$ in our example is of `r round(I2[[3]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to 0, of `r round(I2[[1]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to `r tau[[1]]^2` and of `r round(I2[[2]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to `r tau[[2]]^2`.
The estimate of $H^2$ in our example is of `r round(H2[[3]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to 0, of `r round(H2[[1]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to `r tau[[1]]^2` and of `r round(H2[[2]],2)` when $\tau^2$ is equal to `r tau[[2]]^2`.

#### Presenting the results of a random effects meta-analysis

In order to illustrate the results of a random effects meta-analysis, you can first show the forest plot.
Let's see how it works in our example:

```{r RERMAmetafor,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Forest plots with random effects',fig.subcap=c(paste('$\\tau^2=$',0,sep=''),paste('$\\tau^2=$',tau[[1]]^2,sep=''),paste('$\\tau^2=$',tau[[2]]^2,sep='')), fig.align='center', out.width="33%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
forest(meta.example.RE.ES,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab=expression(paste('Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter,',tau^2,0,sep=' ')))
forest(meta.example.RE.theta.1,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab=expression(paste('Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter,',tau^2,'=','0.25',sep=' ')))
forest(meta.example.RE.theta.2,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab=expression(paste('Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter,',tau^2,'=','1',sep=' ')))
```

Another very nice and useful graphical presentation device is a radial (or Galbraith) plot. 
It relates the invserse of the standard errors to the effect sizes normalized by their standard errors.
Each data point is also related a radius by the line passing through the origin. 
The Radial plot enables to visualize the noise in the dataset, and is especially useful when comparing a fixed and a random effects estimator for the same study.

```{r Radial,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap=paste('Radial plots with fixed and random effects','$\\tau^2=$',tau[[1]]^2,sep=' '),fig.subcap=c('Fixed effects','Random effects'), fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
meta.example.FE.theta.1 <- rma(yi = data.meta$theta.1,vi=data.meta$var.ES,method="FE")
radial(meta.example.FE.theta.1)
radial(meta.example.RE.theta.1)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Radial) shows how the mechanics of the fixed effects estimator differs from the mechanics of the random effects one.
In the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity, the fixed effect estimator faces two issues:

  1. It gives too much weight to very precise estimators.
  The random effects estimator undoes part of this importance by adding $\tau^2$ to the weights of each observation.
  2. It overestimates overall precision by ignoring the sampling variance stemming from treatment effect heterogeneity across sites.
  The random effects estimator corrects for that by estimating $\tau^2$ and adding it to the estimate of the total variance of the treatment effect.
  
```{example}
Let's see how big a difference using random versus fixed effects does to the estimation of treatment effects.
Let's plot the two forest plots for the example with $\tau=$ `r tau[[1]]^2`.
```

```{r FEvsRE,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap=paste('Fixed vs random effects with','$\\tau^2=$',tau[[1]]^2,sep=' '),fig.subcap=c('Fixed effects','Random effects'), fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.pos='htbp', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
forest(meta.example.FE.theta.1,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab='Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter')
forest(meta.example.RE.theta.1,slab = paste('Study',data.meta$id,sep=' '),xlab='Estimated Meta-analytic Parameter')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:FEvsRE) clearly shows that the inclusion of $\tau^2$ in the weights and precision estimates makes a huge difference to the meta-analytic estimate. 
The fixed effects estimator yields an estimate of our treatment effect of `r round(coef(meta.example.FE.theta.1),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*summary(meta.example.FE.theta.1)$se,2)`.
The random effects estimator yields an estimate of our treatment effect of `r round(coef(meta.example.RE.theta.1),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*summary(meta.example.RE.theta.1)$se,2)`.
With $\tau^2=$ `r tau[[2]]^2`, the random effects estimator yields an estimate of our treatment effect of `r round(coef(meta.example.RE.theta.2),2)` $\pm$ `r round(qnorm((delta.2+1)/2)*summary(meta.example.RE.theta.2)$se,2)`.
Remember that the true effect size of our treatment is `r round(ES(param),2)`.
With $\tau^2=$ `r tau[[2]]^2`, the random effects estimator barely contains the truth in its `r delta.2*100` $\%$ confidence interval. 

### Meta-regression

A Meta-regression tries to explain the heterogeneity in treatment effects across studies using observed covariates.
The idea is to identify characteristics of the studies or of the sites that are correlated with how treatment effects vary. 

#### The Meta-regression model

The main equation that we want to estimate is as follows [(Raudenbusch, 2009)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610441384):

\begin{align}
  \hat{\theta}_k & = \mathbf{X}_k \mathbf{\beta}  + \epsilon_k + \nu_k,
\end{align}

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Center regressors at the mean?</span>**

where $\mathbf{X}_k$ is a line vector containing the value of the variables suspected to be correlated with treatment effect heterogeneity for study $k$ and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a column vector of the corresponding coefficients, of the same dimension as $\mathbf{X}_k$.
$\mathbf{X}_k$ contains a $1$ as its first term, so that $\beta_0$, the first component of the vector $\mathbf{\beta}$ measures the effect of the treatment when all other regressors are set to zero.
It might thus be a good idea to set the regressors as deviations around their means if we want $\beta_0$ to capture the average effect of the treatment. 
The error term $\epsilon_k$ captures the heterogeneity in estimated effect sizes that is due to sampling noise.
The error term $\nu_k$ captures the heterogeneity in effect sizes across sites that remains after conditioning on $\mathbf{X}_k$.
In addition, it is generally assumed that $\epsilon_k\sim\mathbf{N}(0,\hat{\sigma}^2_k)$ and  $\nu_k\sim\mathbf{N}(0,\tau^2)$.

This model is in general called the **mixed effects linear model**.
It contains at the same time fixed effects captured by $\mathbf{X}_k \mathbf{\beta}$ and random effects captured by $\nu_k$.
Setting $\tau^2$ to zero generates a **fixed effects linear model**.
It is possible, as usual, to test for whether $\tau^2$ is null or not, which is a test of whether the added covariates fully capture the heterogeneity in treatment effects across studies.

#### Estimating the meta-regression model

There are at least four ways to estimate the meta-regression model:

  1. Weighted Least squares (WLS): mostly used for fixed effects models, where $\tau^2$ is assumed to be zero.
  2. Full Maximum Likelihood Estimator (FMLE)
  3. Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (RMLE)
  4. Method Of Moments (MOM)
  
##### Weighted Least Squares

The Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimator imposes that $\tau^2=0$.
It is thus appropriate when we have a fixed effects linear model.
It is also used as a starting point for estimating the other models.

The WLS estimator of $\mathbf{\beta}$ is written as follows:

\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{\hat{\beta}}_{WLS} & = \left(\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\mathbf{X}_k\right)^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\hat{\theta}_k.
\end{align*}

The WLS estimator is similar to the standard OLS estimator, except that it gives more weight to mmore precise estimates of the treatment effect.
This is a generalization of the weighted average that we have studied in Section \@ref(MetaWA).

##### Full Maximum Likelihood Estimator

The Full Maximum Likelihood Estimator (FMLE) is also a weighted estimator, but, as the random effects estimator presented in Section \@ref(sec:RE), it uses as weigths not only the precision estimates ($\frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}^2_k}$), but the inverse of the sum of the variance due to sampling noise and the variance due to variation in treatment effects across sites.
In order to make all of this clearer, let's define $\omega_k = \epsilon_k + \nu_k$, and let's denote $\zeta^2_{k}=\hat{\sigma}^2_k+\tau^2$ the variance of $\omega_k$.
The estimatingn equations for the FMLE estimator are:

\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{\hat{\beta}}_{FMLE} & = \left(\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\mathbf{X}_k\right)^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\hat{\theta}_k,\\
 \hat{\tau}^2_{FMLE} & = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^4_k}\left((\hat{\theta}_k -\mathbf{X}_k\mathbf{\beta})^2-\hat{\sigma}^2_k\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^4_k}}
\end{align*}

where $\hat{\zeta}^2_k$ is an estimate of $\zeta^2_{k}$. 
In general, the FEML model is estimated by using a first guess for $\mathbf{\beta}$, for example $\mathbf{\hat{\beta}}_{WLS}$.
Using this first estimate, we can compute a first estimate of $\hat{\tau}^2$ and update the set of weights, and iterate until convergence.
 
##### Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator

The Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (RMLE)  is a weigthed estimator that is very similar to the FMLE estimartor, except that the estimation procedure focuses on estimating $\tau^2$ first.
As a consequence, the formula for the $\tau^2$ estimator is different:

\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{\hat{\beta}}_{RMLE} & = \left(\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\mathbf{X}_k\right)^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\hat{\theta}_k,\\
 \hat{\tau}^2_{RMLE} & = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^4_k}\left((\hat{\theta}_k -\mathbf{X}_k\mathbf{\beta})^2-\hat{\sigma}^2_k\right)
                          +\text{tr}\left[\left(\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\mathbf{X}_k\right)^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^2_k}\mathbf{X}_k'\mathbf{X}_k\right]}
                          {\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{1}{\hat{\zeta}^4_k}}
\end{align*}
