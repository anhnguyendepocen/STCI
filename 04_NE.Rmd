# Natural Experiments {#NE}

Natural Experiments are situations due to the natural course of events that approximate the conditions of a randomized controlled trial.
In the economists' toolkit, we generally make a distinction between:

  1. Instrumental variables (IV), that rely on finding a plausibly exogeneous source of variation in treatment intake.
  2. Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD), that exploit a discontinuity in the eligibility to the treatment.
  3. Difference In Differences (DID), that make use of the differential exposure of some groups to the treatment of interest over time.
  
```{remark}
The term *Natural Experiments* seems to be mostly used by economists.
It dates back to Haavelmo (1944)'s paper on the Probability Approach to Econometrics, where he makes a distinction between the experiments we'd like to make as social scientists and the experiments that Nature provides us with, that are in general a subset of the experiments we'd like to make.
This raises the question of our ability to **identify** the relationships of interest from the variation that is present in the data, a traditional problem in classical econometrics that has echoes in treatment effect estimation, where we also try to *identify* treatment effect parameters.
At the time of Haavelmo, and until the beginning of the 1990s, there was no real discussion of the plausibility of the *identifying assumptions* (or restrictions) required for identification of certain relations, outside of a discussion of their theoretical plausiblility.
With the credibility revolution brought about by Angrist (1990)'s paper and summarized in Angrist and Krueger (2001)'s review paper, the notion of natural experiment made a come back, with the idea that we might be able to look for specific set of events produced by Nature that more credibly identify a relationship of interest, *i.e.* that closely approximate true experimental conditions.

```{remarks}
Outside of economics, Natural Experiments have also flourished, but without the term, and were compiled in the early textbook on research methods by Campbell (1966).
Both Difference In Differences and Regression Discontinuity Designs have been actually developed outside of economics, mostly in education research.
Instrumental Variables have had a separate history in economics and in genetics, were it is called the method of path coefficients.

## Instrumental Variables

Instrumental Variables rely on finding a plausibly exogeneous source of variation in treatment intake.
In the simple case of a binary instrument, the identification and estimation parts are actually similar to Encouragements designs in RCTs, that we ahve already studied in Section \@ref(sec:design4).
The crucial part of an IV design is to justify the credibility of the exclusion restriction and independence assumptions, which are generally extremely hard to justify.
